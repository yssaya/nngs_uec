We at NNGS wish to credit the Free Internet Chess Server folks for giving us
their source code to start from.  Thanks!

                     the original server. Without him, the chess server

  Daniel Sleator -   Author of AICS and responsible for many of the ideas
                     that makes the chess server as popular as it is.
