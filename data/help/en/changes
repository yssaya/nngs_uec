  See ahelp aban.
  - .../lists/ban[.default] : persistent storage for the ban list.

  Corrected clock-keeping (black's 1st move used white's clock ...)
    (this was caused by 'courtesy' for handicap, which is negotiated before
    black's first move)

  Uncommented a call to game_update_times(): observers now get the
  correct time

  Fixed filename-generation, including links.
  The current implementation stores two links to the sgffile:
  (for players "Jimmy White" && "Karen Black")
  .../b/jimmy-karen-20040919
