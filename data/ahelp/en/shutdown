USAGE: shutdown [now,cancel,time]

RESTRICTED TO ADMINISTRATORS.

If the parameter is omitted or is 'now' then the server is immediately
halted cleanly.

If a time is given then a countdown commences and the server is halted
when time is up. Time is in SECONDS.

If 'cancel' is given then the countdown is stopped.

NOTE: If you think you need to shutdown the server, you're probably wrong.

NOTE: Normally, a shutdown will write the open userfiles to disk.
      Performing a shutdown while in a disk-full conditions will cause
      all open files to be truncated.
