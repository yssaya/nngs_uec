/*
 * Note: the player array is used as a cache for the player data file.
 * An entry can refer to a currently unconnected player. This happens
 * when logging on, or when stats are reqested for someone who is absent.
 * In the original version of NNGS, offline players were put into
 * a temporal slot, which was read+used+discarded. These entries were
 * returned by the various player_xxx() function with negative indexes,
 * which needed a lot of special handling.
 * In this version, player data is kept in the array until the
 * space is reclaimed. Most of the writes to the player datafile
 * have been replaced by a call to player_dirty(), which just
 * sets the dirty-bit. The write is done later. Probably :-]
 *
 * Whenever a new slot is needed, it is basically allocated from the
 * top. The original server allocated the lowest *unconnected* slot.
 * The "application code" is responsible for unlocking the slot after
 * use.
 *
 * To mimic the old behavior, some shuffling is done to move the unconnected
 * slots up. This is less costly than disk-i/o, anyway.
 *
 * Most of the 'slotstate' has been decomposed into separate (bit)fields.
 * This is easier to read, and easier to maintain, IMHO, than relying on
 * an aggregate (pstatus), which is there for other reasons.
 *
 * The fixcount-stuff is useless, currently. It could come into use
 * if we became multithreading. It does help to detect logical flaws
 * ("lock leaks").
